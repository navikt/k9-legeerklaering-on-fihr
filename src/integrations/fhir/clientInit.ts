 * round trip to the smart server. When it is not a launch URL, it looks for and uses the auth token stored in browser local
 * storage. If the auth token is not found in local storage, or is expired it will give a "not authorized" error. The
 * user must then reauthenticate by opening the window again from the EHR system to get a new launch url.
